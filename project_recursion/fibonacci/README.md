# Fibonacci Sequence
The first project in Project: Recursion (Ruby Programming)

This module contains two methods that take a number and return that many members of the Fibonacci sequence:
* Fibonacci.fibs - solves the problem using iteration
* Fibonacci.fibs_rec - solves the problem using recursion
